# 1 - A* implementation

A* is a **pathfinding algorithm** used to find the shortest path between two points in a graph. 
It is widely used in games and robotics, it uses Dijsktra algorithm as a base, adding a heuristic approach to guide the search. 

If you want to learn more about the algorithm, I recommend watching [Sebastian Lague's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L-WgKMFuhE&t=50s&ab_channel=SebastianLague) on the subject.

## Objective
The objective of this project is not to create the most efficient implementation of the algorithm, but to learn about the go programming language, data structures and project structure.


## Results
The project is running and the algorithm is able to find the shortest path between two points in a simple grid.

There is room for improvement in many ways:
- The algorithm can be optimized to avoid performing unnecessary searches on some data structures. 
- Probably using more sophisticated data structures would improve the performance of the algorithm.
- Some tooling would help to create different scenarios to compare the performance of the algorithm. 
- It would be interesting to measure the performance of the algorithm in different scenarios and compare it with other implementations.
- Some testing would be nice to ensure the correctness of the implementation.

**Some of these topics will be addressed in future projects, but for now, the objective was achieved.**
