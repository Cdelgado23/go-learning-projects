# 2 - Web server

Web servers need something else apart from the ability to handle requests and responses. They need to be able to access
data and perform operations on it in a way that is efficient and easy to maintain. This is where the architecture of the
web service comes into play.

## Objective

This project is focused on improving the architecture of the web service to allow more complex scenarios and better
handling of the data.

To achieve this, the project will adress the following points:

- Implementing a nodes repository to handler the access to the nodes data.
- Injecting the repository into the service.
- Implementing a test to validate the endpoint behaviour.
